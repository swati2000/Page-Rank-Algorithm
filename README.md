# Page-Rank-Algorithm

####Imagine we have 100 Procrastinating Pats on our micro-internet, each viewing a single website at a time. Each minute the Pats follow a link on their website to another site on the micro-internet. After a while, the websites that are most linked to will have more Pats visiting them, and in the long run, each minute for every Pat that leaves a website, another will enter keeping the total numbers of Pats on each website constant. The PageRank is simply the ranking of websites by how many Pats they have on them at the end of this process.
